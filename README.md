# Optimization-using-Steepest-Hill-and-Genetic-Algorithms


- Implemented a project focused on optimization using two distinct algorithms: Steepest Hill and Genetic Algorithms.
- Utilized these algorithms to solve complex optimization problems represented using nodes.
- The Steepest Hill algorithm employed a gradient-based approach, making incremental improvements by iteratively selecting the steepest ascent direction.
- The Genetic Algorithm, inspired by natural selection, used a population-based approach to evolve solutions over multiple generations.
- The project showcased problem-solving skills in various domains by applying these algorithms to address specific optimization challenges.
- Successfully demonstrated the ability to find near-optimal solutions in complex node-based scenarios through these two distinct optimization techniques.
